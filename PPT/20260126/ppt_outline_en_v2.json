      "notes": "Good morning/afternoon, everyone! Today I'll present the latest progress on our EcAZ phage project.\n\nThe goal is to isolate bacteriophages that can infect EcAZ E. coli from sewage samples. We use two host strains: wild-type W strain and OVA-expressing R strain.\n\nI'll cover phage isolation, host range, titer determination, and killing curves."

This may be related to the OVA protein on R strain surface.\n\nSecond, R2 is the only phage producing turbid plaques, suggesting it may be a temperate phage.\n\nThird, R3 has the largest plaques - over 3mm in diameter, more than 15 times larger than R1."

Note the size heterogeneity due to spreading behavior.\n\nW1 and W2 have intermediate-sized clear plaques."

R1 shows moderate efficiency. R2 shows almost no lysis, confirming its temperate nature.\n\nConditions: 37°C, BioTek Epoch 2, 12-hour continuous monitoring."

This makes it the top candidate for phage therapy applications.\n\nSecond, R2 shows almost no lysis effect. Combined with its turbid plaque morphology, we can confirm R2 is a temperate phage that enters the lysogenic cycle rather than lytic cycle."
