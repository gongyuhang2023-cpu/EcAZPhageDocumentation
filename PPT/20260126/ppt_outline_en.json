The goal of this project is to isolate bacteriophages that can infect EcAZ E. coli strains from sewage samples.\n\nI'll cover the project background, isolation results, host range determination, titer determination, and killing curve experiments."

      ],
      "notes": "Let me start with the project background.\n\nOur core objective is to isolate bacteriophages capable of infecting EcAZ E. coli from sewage samples. Sewage is a natural reservoir of phage diversity.\n\nWe used two host strains: EcAZ-1, a wild-type strain we call W, and EcAZ-2-OVA, an engineered strain expressing OVA antigen, which we call R."

      "notes": "Through multiple rounds of enrichment and purification, we successfully isolated five bacteriophages.\n\nR1, R2, and R3 were enriched using the R strain, while W1 and W2 were enriched using the W strain.\n\nThese five phages exhibit distinct plaque morphologies: R1 produces tiny plaques, R2 produces turbid plaques, and R3 produces large, clear plaques."

      "notes": "Host range determination revealed an important finding: R1 can only infect the R strain and completely fails to infect the W strain.\n\nThis is the only **narrow-host-range** phage among all five isolates!\n\nOne possible explanation is that the OVA protein expressed on the R strain's surface creates a unique receptor that R1 specifically recognizes."
