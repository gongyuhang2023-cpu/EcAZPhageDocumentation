## Objective

To observe and document the plaque morphology characteristics of 5 phage strains (R1, R2, R3, W1, W2) on their respective host bacteria.

---

## Materials

### Phages
| Name | Host | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| R1 | EcAZ-2-OVA | |
| R2 | EcAZ-2-OVA | |
| R3 | EcAZ-2-OVA | High titer |
| W1 | EcAZ-1 | |
| W2 | EcAZ-1 | Isolated from W1 |

### Reagents
| Reagent | Specification | Volume | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| LB agar plates | 1.5% | | Bottom layer |
| Soft agar | 0.7% | 3mL/plate | Top layer |
| Log-phase host bacteria | OD600~0.5 | 200uL/plate | |

### Equipment
- [x] 37°C incubator
- [x] Ruler/Caliper (for measuring plaque diameter)
- [ ] Camera (for photo documentation) - **Pending**

---

## Protocol

### Double-Layer Agar Plate Method
1. Prepare LB bottom agar plates
2. Prepare soft agar, cool to approximately 50°C
3. Add 200uL log-phase host bacteria and appropriate diluted phage
4. Mix and pour onto bottom agar layer
5. Incubate at 37°C overnight

### Morphological Observation
1. Measure plaque diameter (at least 5 plaques)
2. Record plaque clarity (Clear/Turbid)
3. Observe presence of halo
4. Photo documentation

## Results

### Raw Measurement Data

| Phage | Measurements (mm) | Average |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| R1 | 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1 | 0.1-0.2 |
| R2 | 2, 2, 2, 1.5, 1.5, 2 | 1.8±0.3 |
| R3 | 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3 | 3.2±0.8 |
| W1 | 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5 | ~0.5 |
| W2 | 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2 | 2.2±0.4 |

### Morphology Summary

| Phage | Diameter (mm) | Clarity | Halo | Characteristics |
|-------|---------------|---------|------|-----------------|
| R1 | 0.1-0.2 | Clear | Yes | Very small plaques |
| R2 | 1.8±0.3 | Turbid | No | Turbid plaques |
| R3 | 3.2±0.8 | Clear | Yes | Largest plaques |
| W1 | ~0.5 | Clear | Yes | Small plaques |
| W2 | 2.2±0.4 | Clear | Yes | Medium-sized |

### Classification

By plaque size:
- **Very small (<0.5mm)**: R1 (0.1-0.2mm)
- **Small (0.5-1mm)**: W1 (0.5mm)
- **Medium (1-2.5mm)**: R2 (1.8mm), W2 (2.2mm)
- **Large (>2.5mm)**: R3 (3.2mm)

### Conclusions

1. The 5 phage strains show distinct differences in plaque size
2. **R2 is the only phage producing turbid plaques**, suggesting it may be a temperate or lysogenic phage
3. R3 has the largest plaques and highest titer, consistent with observations during isolation
