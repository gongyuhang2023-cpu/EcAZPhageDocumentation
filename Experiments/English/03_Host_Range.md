## Objective

To determine the host range of 5 phage strains (R1, R2, R3, W1, W2) against two host bacteria (EcAZ-1 and EcAZ-2-OVA) through cross-infection testing.

## Materials

### Phages
| Name | Original Host | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| R1 | EcAZ-2-OVA | Very small plaques |
| R2 | EcAZ-2-OVA | Turbid plaques |
| R3 | EcAZ-2-OVA | Large plaques, high titer |
| W1 | EcAZ-1 | Small plaques |
| W2 | EcAZ-1 | Medium plaques |

### Test Strains
| Name | Code | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| EcAZ-1 | W | Wild type |
| EcAZ-2-OVA | R | OVA-expressing |

### Reagents
| Reagent | Specification | Volume | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| LB agar plates | 1.5% | | |
| Soft agar | 0.7% | | |
| Log-phase culture | OD600~0.5 | | |

### Equipment
- [x] Multichannel pipette
- [x] 37°C incubator

## Protocol

### Spot Test Method (R/W Bacteria/Phage Cross-Validation)
1. Prepare double-layer agar plates with different host bacteria
2. Serial dilute each phage strain (10^-1, 10^-2, 10^-3)
3. Spot 5uL onto plates
4. Incubate at 37°C overnight
5. Observe clear zone formation

### Scoring Criteria
- **+++**: Clear transparent zone
- **++**: Semi-transparent zone
- **+**: Turbid zone
- **-**: No zone

## Experimental Records

| Time | Operation | Observations/Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 11-24~30 | Host range experiment | R/W bacteria/phage cross-validation |
| 12-04 | Final confirmation | |

## Results

### Spot Test Results

| Phage | EcAZ-2-OVA (R strain) | EcAZ-1 (W strain) |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|
| R1 | +++ | **-** |
| R2 | +++ | +++ |
| R3 | +++ | +++ |
| W1 | +++ | +++ |
| W2 | +++ | +++ |

### Host Range Classification

| Phage | Host Range Type | Susceptible Strains |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **R1** | **Narrow host range** | **EcAZ-2-OVA only** |
| R2 | Broad host range | Both strains |
| R3 | Broad host range | Both strains |
| W1 | Broad host range | Both strains |
| W2 | Broad host range | Both strains |

### Conclusions

1. **4 out of 5 phage strains have broad host range**, capable of infecting both EcAZ-1 and EcAZ-2-OVA
2. **R1 is the only narrow host range phage**, can only infect EcAZ-2-OVA (R strain)
3. The host specificity of R1 warrants further investigation, possibly related to surface receptors associated with OVA expression

---

## Problems and Improvements

- Consider expanding test strain panel to include more E. coli strains
- The narrow host range mechanism of R1 is worth in-depth study
