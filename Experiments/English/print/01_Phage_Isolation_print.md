# Phage Isolation

**Date:** 2024-11-06 ~ 2024-11-22 | **Operator:** Yuhang Gong | **Status:** Completed

## Objective
Isolate bacteriophages capable of infecting EcAZ-1 (W strain) and EcAZ-2-OVA (R strain) from wastewater samples.

## Materials

**Bacterial Strains:** EcAZ-1 (W, wild type), EcAZ-2-OVA (R, OVA-expressing) — Amir Zarrinar Lab

**Reagents:** 2× LB medium, SM buffer, 0.22 µm filter, Soft agar (0.7%), LB agar plates (1.5%)

**Equipment:** Centrifuge, Filtration apparatus (0.22 µm), 37°C shaker, 37°C incubator, Micropipette

## Protocol

**Sample Processing:** Centrifuge wastewater → Collect supernatant → Filter through 0.22 µm

**Phage Enrichment:** Overnight host culture + 2× LB + wastewater supernatant → 37°C shaking overnight → Centrifuge → Filter

**Screening & Purification:** Spot Test → Plaque Assay (serial dilutions) → Single clone isolation (5–6 rounds)

## Experimental Records

### Phase 1: Enrichment and Initial Screening (11-06 ~ 11-08)
| Date | Operation | Results/Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 11-06 | Obtain phage enrichments from wastewater for R and W strains | - |
| 11-06 | Perform spot test | - |
| 11-07 | Observe spot test results | Preliminary confirmation of phage presence |
| 11-07 | Perform plaque assay at 10⁻⁹ to 10⁻¹¹ dilutions | - |
| 11-08 | Observe plaque assay results | R strain: 4 plaque types; W strain: 2 types |
| 11-08 | Pick single clones for enrichment | R strain: 4 types; W strain: 2 types |

### Phase 2: First Round Purification (11-09 ~ 11-10)
| Date | Operation | Results/Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 11-09 | Enrich R strain (4 types) and W strain (2 types) phages | Obtain enrichments |
| 11-09 | Perform plaque assay (10⁻⁹, 10⁻¹⁰, 10⁻¹¹, 10⁻¹² dilutions) | - |
| 11-10 | Observe first purification results | **R strain fails** (too concentrated); **W strain succeeds** but minor contamination remains |

### Phase 3: Continued Purification (11-11 ~ 11-16)
| Date | Operation | Results/Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 11-11 | R strain: Plaque assay at 10⁻¹⁰ and 10⁻¹⁵ dilutions | Contamination remains, continue selection |
| 11-11 | W strain: Pick single clones, enrich | Prepare for third purification |
| 11-12 | W strain: Continue clone selection and enrichment | Small plaques disappear (unstable phage, abandon) |
| 11-12 | R strain: Centrifuge, filter, store in refrigerator | R strain culture fails, re-culture |
| 11-13 | W strain 4th purification: Plaque assay (10⁻⁹/10⁻¹¹/10⁻¹³) | - |
| 11-13 | R strain 3rd purification: Plaque assay (10⁻⁹/10⁻¹¹/10⁻¹³) | - |
| 11-14 | W strain post-4th purification enrichment | **Retain 2 morphotype phages** |
| 11-14 | R strain post-3rd purification enrichment | **Retain 3 morphotype phages** |
| 11-15 | W strain 5th purification: Plaque assay (10⁻⁹/10⁻¹¹/10⁻¹³) | - |
| 11-15 | R strain 4th purification: Plaque assay (10⁻⁹/10⁻¹¹/10⁻¹³) | - |
| 11-16 | Observe results | W and R strains are essentially pure, minor contamination remains |
| 11-16 | Enrich | Pipette tips work better than inoculation loops |

### Phase 4: Final Purification and Naming (11-17 ~ 11-22)
| Date | Operation | Results/Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 11-17 | Centrifuge enrichments, store in refrigerator | - |
| 11-18 | Prepare bottom agar plates | - |
| 11-19 | Perform plaque assay (10⁻¹⁰/10⁻¹²/10⁻¹⁴ dilutions) | - |
| 11-20 | Observe results | R3 still too concentrated (need 10⁻¹⁴/10⁻¹⁶/10⁻¹⁸); W1 splits into two types (name W1 and W2) |
| 11-21 | Perform plaque assay | - |
| 11-22 | Observe results | Purification complete, prepare stock |

## Results

**5 phage strains** are successfully isolated:

| Phage ID | Enrichment Host | Purification | Storage |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| R1 | EcAZ-2-OVA (R) | 4–5 rounds | 4°C |
| R2 | EcAZ-2-OVA (R) | 4–5 rounds | 4°C |
| R3 | EcAZ-2-OVA (R) | 4–5 rounds | 4°C (high titer) |
| W1 | EcAZ-1 (W) | 5–6 rounds | 4°C |
| W2 | EcAZ-1 (W) | 5–6 rounds | 4°C (from W1) |

## Conclusions
1. 5 phage strains are successfully isolated from wastewater
2. R strain yields 3 (R1, R2, R3); W strain yields 2 (W1, W2)
3. R3 has high titer, requiring dilutions >10⁻¹⁴
4. W2 is separated from W1 during purification
5. **Use pipette tips instead of inoculation loops** for picking single clones
