### Samples
| Name | Source | Collection Date | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------|

### Reagents
| Reagent | Specification | Volume | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------|-------|
| 2x LB | | | For enrichment |
| SM Buffer | | | For storage |
| 0.22um filter | | | |
| Soft agar | 0.7% | | Double-layer plates |
| LB agar plates | 1.5% | | Hard agar |

### Equipment

- [x] Filtration apparatus (0.22um)
- [x] 37°C shaker
- [x] 37°C incubator
- [x] Micropipette (better than inoculation loop)

## Protocol

### Sample Processing
1. Centrifuge wastewater samples
2. Collect supernatant and filter through 0.22um membrane

### Phage Enrichment
1. Prepare overnight host bacterial culture
2. Prepare enrichment mixture: 2xLB + wastewater supernatant + overnight culture
3. Incubate at 37°C with shaking overnight
4. Centrifuge to remove bacterial debris, filter through 0.22um

### Phage Screening and Purification
1. **Spot Test**: Spot enrichment on plates containing host bacteria
2. **Plaque Assay**: Double-layer agar method with serial dilutions
3. **Single Clone Isolation**: Pick single plaques, repeat purification (5-6 rounds)

### Phage Storage
1. Centrifuge enrichment
2. Store at 4°C

## Experimental Records

### Phase 1: Enrichment and Initial Screening (11-06 ~ 11-08)

| Date | Operation | Results/Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 11-06 | Obtained phage enrichments from wastewater for R and W strains | |
| 11-06 | Conducted Spot test | |
| 11-07 | Observed Spot test results | Preliminary confirmation of phage presence |
| 11-07 | Plaque assay with 10^-9 to 10^-11 dilutions | |
| 11-08 | Observed Plaque assay results | R strain: 4 different plaque types; W strain: 2 types |
| 11-08 | Selected single clones for enrichment | R strain: 4 types; W strain: 2 types |

### Phase 2: First Round Purification (11-09 ~ 11-10)

| Date | Operation | Results/Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 11-09 | Enrichment of R (4 types) and W (2 types) phages | Obtained enrichments |
| 11-09 | Plaque assay (10^-9, 10^-10, 10^-11, 10^-12 dilutions) | |
| 11-10 | Observed first purification results | **R strain failed** (too concentrated); **W strain succeeded** but still had minor contamination |

### Phase 3: Continued Purification (11-11 ~ 11-16)

| Date | Operation | Results/Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 11-11 | R strain: Plaque assay at 10^-10 and 10^-15 dilutions | Still contaminated, continued selection |
| 11-11 | W strain: Selected single clones for enrichment | Prepared for third purification |
| 11-12 | W strain: Continued clone selection and enrichment | Small plaques disappeared (unstable phage, abandoned) |
| 11-12 | R strain: Centrifuged, filtered, stored in refrigerator | R strain culture failed, re-cultured |
| 11-13 | W strain - 4th purification: Plaque assay (10^-9/11/13) | |
| 11-13 | R strain - 3rd purification: Plaque assay (10^-9/11/13) | |
| 11-14 | W strain - Post-4th purification enrichment | **Retained 2 morphotype phages** |
| 11-14 | R strain - Post-3rd purification enrichment | **Retained 3 morphotype phages** |
| 11-15 | W strain - 5th purification: Plaque assay (10^-9/11/13) | |
| 11-15 | R strain - 4th purification: Plaque assay (10^-9/11/13) | |
| 11-16 | Observed results | W and R strains essentially pure, minor contamination remaining |
| 11-16 | Enrichment | Pipette tips work better than inoculation loops (loops scrape surrounding areas) |

### Phase 4: Final Purification and Naming (11-17 ~ 11-22)

| Date | Operation | Results/Notes |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 11-17 | Centrifuged enrichments, stored in refrigerator | |
| 11-18 | Prepared hard agar plates | |
| 11-19 | Plaque assay (10^-10/12/14 dilutions) | |
| 11-20 | Observed results | R3 still too concentrated after dilution (need 14/16/18); W1 split into two types (named W1 and W2) |
| 11-21 | Plaque assay | |
| 11-22 | Observed results | Pure enrichments prepared as stocks |

## Results

### Isolation Summary

Successfully isolated **5 phage strains**:

| Phage ID | Enrichment Host | Purification Rounds | Storage |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| R1 | EcAZ-2-OVA (R strain) | 4-5 rounds | 4°C |
| R2 | EcAZ-2-OVA (R strain) | 4-5 rounds | 4°C |
| R3 | EcAZ-2-OVA (R strain) | 4-5 rounds | 4°C (high titer, requires high dilution) |
| W1 | EcAZ-1 (W strain) | 5-6 rounds | 4°C |
| W2 | EcAZ-1 (W strain) | 5-6 rounds | 4°C (isolated from W1) |

### Conclusions

1. Successfully isolated 5 phage strains from wastewater
2. R strain enrichment yielded 3 strains (R1, R2, R3); W strain yielded 2 strains (W1, W2)
3. R3 has particularly high titer, requiring higher dilutions (>10^-14)
4. W2 was separated from W1 during purification
5. One unstable phage with small plaques disappeared during purification and was not retained

## Problems and Improvements

### Problems Encountered
1. R strain first plaque assay failed due to excessive concentration
2. R strain culture failed once (clear LB, no growth), required re-cultivation
3. Inoculation loop easily scrapes surrounding plaques when picking single clones

### Improvements
1. High-titer phages like R3 require higher dilutions (14/16/18-fold)
2. **Use pipette tips instead of inoculation loops** for picking single clones - more effective
3. Replace bacterial cultures weekly
